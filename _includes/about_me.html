			Under construction..........
            I have over 3 years of experience as a electrical engineer, and have worked
            balblalba. balbla, my expertise is in building scalable backend services (API services, stream processing,
            and async mechanisms).

           Under construction....
		   I love building things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle, abalbabablalbabl
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
           I'm looking for a senior individual contributor role where I can take on on collaborative
           team leadership responsibilites, and gain experience with blöalblabla
           architecture and project management.

		    <ul>
    			<li>
            Researched and implemented a novel mass production method for active precision alignment 
			of optical components with submicron accuracy. 
    			</li>
          <li>
            Designed an analog laser driver with encompassing self-diagnostics. Reduced pic cost and kept knowledge in-house.
          <li>
            Re-designed a high end lidar final inspection test procedure to function with one piece flow principle. Work led to faster takt time and less out-of-the-box failures.  
    			<li>
            Researched and build a power scavenging device able to convert ambient radio frequency emissions into DC power. Presented the results and a working prototype,
			in the IEEE Internal Symposium on Antennas and Propagation/USNC-URSI National Radio Science meeting in Puerto Rico, 2015, and was awarded a second place.
    			</li>
    			<li>
            Steered a 14-meter telescope, located in Metsähovi research center. Main targets were active galactic nuclei, like renowned M87.
